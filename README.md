```html
<p>This is a HTML paragraph</p>

```javascript
let randomNumber = Math.random();

Here's a list with something that could follow the above code as instructions. 

- first point
- second point
- third point
  -  indented point
     1. itemized list
     2. itemized list 
 

Add in some block quotes to highlight some important point
> Make sure to run all tests before committing your code

Here's a table with some extra columns that could contain stuff like supported OS versions

| heading1 | heading2 | heading3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| column1 | column2 | column3 |
